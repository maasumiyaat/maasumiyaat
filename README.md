## 👋 Hi,

I’m a Software Engineer who loves building systems that are fast, scalable, and reliable. Backend engineering is where I feel most at home — designing APIs, working with databases, architecting services, digging into communication protocols, and tuning performance. I enjoy jumping into the frontend world too, because seeing the full picture always matters.

I’ve built, launched, and maintained production systems — and learned a lot through those real-world battles. I stay curious, proactive, and always improving. I believe software is a craft, and I take joy in doing it well.

I write about problems I face and the solutions that emerge. Occasionally, I’m available for consulting and contract work.
